## Decoding Regional Preferences and Ratings 

## Abstract
This research project aims to uncover the underlying factors that influence beer ratings and determine how these factors vary across different regions. The motivation behind the study includes but is not limited to understanding whether smaller breweries with limited beer selections are favored over larger ones on a global scale, how regional predictors affect beer ratings, and the pattern of the user factor’s influence on rating . We seek to tell the story of regional beer appreciation, exploring the degree of localized preferences’  impact on a beer’s success and reputation. By analyzing beer ratings and reviews, this project will identify key predictors of beer popularity, investigate regional variations in these predictors, and examine the correlation between the number of reviews and beer ratings. A critical component of the study is to establish a methodology for sourcing representative and reliable data from users to ensure the validity of our findings. The outcomes of this research will provide valuable insights for breweries to tailor their products to regional tastes and for enthusiasts to understand global beer trends.

## Research questions:
- What are the main predictors of a beer’s rating ?
- How do those predictors regionalize ?
- Do breweries with smaller beer selection cater more than bigger breweries to their market ? 
- Is the rating influenced by the number of reviews?
